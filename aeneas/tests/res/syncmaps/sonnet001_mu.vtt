00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.680
I

2
00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.879
From fairest creatures
we desire increase,

3
00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.199
That thereby beauty’s rose
might never die,

4
00:00:09.199 --> 00:00:11.960
But as the riper
should by time decease,

5
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.240
His tender heir
might bear his memory:

6
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.519
But thou contracted
to thine own bright eyes,

7
00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:22.760
Feed’st thy light’s flame
with self-substantial fuel,

8
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.679
Making a famine
where abundance lies,

9
00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:31.239
Thy self thy foe,
to thy sweet self too cruel:

10
00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:34.399
Thou that art now
the world’s fresh ornament,

11
00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:36.640
And only herald to the gaudy spring,

12
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.640
Within thine own bud
buriest thy content,

13
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.640
And tender churl mak’st waste in niggarding:

14
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.079
Pity the world,
or else this glutton be,

15
00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:53.240
To eat the world’s due,
by the grave and thee.
