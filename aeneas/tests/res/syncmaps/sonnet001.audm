2.640	5.880	From fairest creatures we desire increase,
5.880	9.240	That thereby beauty's rose might never die,
9.240	11.920	But as the riper should by time decease,
11.920	15.280	His tender heir might bear his memory:
15.280	18.800	But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,
18.800	22.760	Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,
22.760	25.680	Making a famine where abundance lies,
25.680	31.240	Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:
31.240	34.400	Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,
34.400	36.920	And only herald to the gaudy spring,
36.920	40.640	Within thine own bud buriest thy content,
40.640	43.640	And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:
43.640	48.080	Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
48.080	53.240	To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.
