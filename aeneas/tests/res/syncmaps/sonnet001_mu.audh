00:00:00.000	00:00:02.640	I
00:00:02.640	00:00:05.880	From fairest creatures we desire increase,
00:00:05.880	00:00:09.240	That thereby beauty’s rose might never die,
00:00:09.240	00:00:11.640	But as the riper should by time decease,
00:00:11.640	00:00:15.240	His tender heir might bear his memory:
00:00:15.240	00:00:18.560	But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,
00:00:18.560	00:00:22.800	Feed’st thy light’s flame with self-substantial fuel,
00:00:22.800	00:00:25.680	Making a famine where abundance lies,
00:00:25.680	00:00:31.240	Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:
00:00:31.240	00:00:34.280	Thou that art now the world’s fresh ornament,
00:00:34.280	00:00:36.960	And only herald to the gaudy spring,
00:00:36.960	00:00:40.680	Within thine own bud buriest thy content,
00:00:40.680	00:00:43.600	And tender churl mak’st waste in niggarding:
00:00:43.600	00:00:48.080	Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
00:00:48.080	00:00:53.240	To eat the world’s due, by the grave and thee.
