00:00:02.640,00:00:05.880
From fairest creatures[br]we desire increase,

00:00:05.880,00:00:09.240
That thereby beauty's rose[br]might never die,

00:00:09.240,00:00:11.920
But as the riper[br]should by time decease,

00:00:11.920,00:00:15.280
His tender heir[br]might bear his memory:

00:00:15.280,00:00:18.800
But thou contracted[br]to thine own bright eyes,

00:00:18.800,00:00:22.760
Feed'st thy light's flame[br]with self-substantial fuel,

00:00:22.760,00:00:25.680
Making a famine[br]where abundance lies,

00:00:25.680,00:00:31.240
Thy self thy foe,[br]to thy sweet self too cruel:

00:00:31.240,00:00:34.400
Thou that art now[br]the world's fresh ornament,

00:00:34.400,00:00:36.920
And only herald to the gaudy spring,

00:00:36.920,00:00:40.640
Within thine own bud[br]buriest thy content,

00:00:40.640,00:00:43.640
And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:

00:00:43.640,00:00:48.080
Pity the world,[br]or else this glutton be,

00:00:48.080,00:00:53.240
To eat the world's due,[br]by the grave and thee.
