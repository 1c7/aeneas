      <p xml:id="f000003" begin="5.880s" end="9.240s">That thereby beauty's rose might never die,</p>
      <p xml:id="f000004" begin="9.240s" end="11.760s">But as the riper should by time decease,</p>
      <p xml:id="f000005" begin="11.760s" end="14.440s">His tender heir might bear his memory:</p>
      <p xml:id="f000006" begin="14.440s" end="18.560s">But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,</p>
      <p xml:id="f000007" begin="18.560s" end="22.280s">Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,</p>

      <p xml:id="f000011" begin="34.400s" end="36.960s">And only herald to the gaudy spring,</p>

      <p xml:id="f000015" begin="48.120s" end="53.240s">To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.</p>
