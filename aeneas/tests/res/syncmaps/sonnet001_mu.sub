I

00:00:02.680,00:00:05.879
From fairest creatures[br]we desire increase,

00:00:05.879,00:00:09.199
That thereby beauty’s rose[br]might never die,

00:00:09.199,00:00:11.960
But as the riper[br]should by time decease,

00:00:11.960,00:00:15.240
His tender heir[br]might bear his memory:

00:00:15.240,00:00:18.519
But thou contracted[br]to thine own bright eyes,

00:00:18.519,00:00:22.760
Feed’st thy light’s flame[br]with self-substantial fuel,

00:00:22.760,00:00:25.679
Making a famine[br]where abundance lies,

00:00:25.679,00:00:31.239
Thy self thy foe,[br]to thy sweet self too cruel:

00:00:31.239,00:00:34.399
Thou that art now[br]the world’s fresh ornament,

00:00:34.399,00:00:36.640
And only herald to the gaudy spring,

00:00:36.640,00:00:40.640
Within thine own bud[br]buriest thy content,

00:00:40.640,00:00:43.640
And tender churl mak’st waste in niggarding:

00:00:43.640,00:00:48.079
Pity the world,[br]or else this glutton be,

00:00:48.079,00:00:53.240
To eat the world’s due,[br]by the grave and thee.
